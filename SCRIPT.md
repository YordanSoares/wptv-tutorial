*Hi, this is a tutorial to show you how to edit raw videos before submitting them to Wordpress Tv.

*The main goal of this tutorial is to learn how to cut unwanted part of the video, usually at the beginning or at the end of the video, how to add intro and outro slides (more info here: https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/video-editing/#3-add-intro-and-outro-panels) and, if needed, presentations slides

*In this tutorial we're going to use Shotcut, a multiplatform and open source video editor. You can download the version for your operating system from the official site shotcut.org.

*Once installed, open Shotcut and this is the default view of the application.

*The tabs we need are Properties, Playlist, Filters and Export on the left, Source and Project at the center, Jobs on the right and the Timeline at the bottom.

*If you can't see these tabs, click on "View" on the main menu and choose the tabs you want to activate.

*Now that your editor is ready, we're going to import the media we want to include in the project.

*You'll need the video of course, the intro and outro panels and, if needed, some or all of the slides of the presentation.

*To import our media click on "Open File" icon on the main bar and choose all the files you want to import, then click "Open".

*Now you can see your imported files in the Playlist tab.

*Before proceeding, we can set a useful default setting that can save some time in editing and make our process more consistent.

*Select one of the image imported and click on the "Properties" tab.

*Here we can set a default duration for image files in our video, set it to 3 seconds, or the duration you think is best for you video.

*Now we can start working on our video.

*To add a media to the project timeline drag the media from the Playlist on the Timeline at the bottom of the screen.

*Now that our video is in the Timeline, we can trim the unwanted footage at the beginning and at the end of the video.

*To do so we have to split the video and then delete the unwanted clip.

*To trim the beginning place the playhead at the end of the part you want to trim, right click on the playhead and select "Split as Playhead" on the pop-up window.

*Now that the unwanted part is separated from the main video, click on the part you want to remove and press Del/Canc key or choose "Remove" from the right click pop-up window.

*You can trim the end of the video if needed in the same way.

*Do the same if you have to cut some of the footage in the middle of the video.

*Then we'll add the dissolve effect to make the transition between the clips smoother.

*To do so, for example to blend the intro panel and the beginning of the video, click on the video and drag it on the left over the panel of about 1 second. Now you can see that Shotcut added a dissolve effect automatically.

*To add the same effect to the outro panel go at the end of the video (using the bottom scroll bar or the End key) and drag in the same way the outro panel onto the video track.

*Now we have a complete video with intro and outro panel and nice transitions, but in some cases we need to add some slides to the video, for example when there's important info to show to the viewer.

*To add a slide we have to create a new video track first.

*Right click on the bottom left panel and choose "Add Video Track" from the pop-up window.
