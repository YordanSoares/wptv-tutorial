*Hi, this is a tutorial to show you how to edit raw videos before submitting them to Wordpress Tv.

*The main goal of this tutorial is to learn how to cut unwanted part of the video, usually at the beginning or at the end of the video, how to add intro and outro slides and, if needed, presentations slides

*In this tutorial we're going to use Shotcut, a multiplatform and open source video editor. You can download the version for your operating system from the official site shotcut.org.

*Once installed, open Shotcut and this is the default view of the application.

*The tabs we need are Properties, Playlist and Export on the left, Source and Project at the center, Jobs on the right and the Timeline at the bottom.

*If you can't see these tabs, click on "View" on the main menu and choose the tabs you want to activate.

*Now that your editor is ready, we're going to import the media we want to include in the project.

*You'll need the video of course, the intro and outro panels and, if needed, some or all of the slides of the presentation.

*To import our media click on "Open File" icon on the main bar and choose all the files you want to import, then click "Open".

*Now you can see your imported files in the Playlist tab.

*Before proceeding, we can set a useful default setting that can save some time in editing and make our process more consistent.

*Select one of the image imported and click on the "Properties" tab.

*Here we can set a default duration for image files in our video, set it to 3 seconds, or the duration you think is best for you video.

*Now we can start working on our video.
