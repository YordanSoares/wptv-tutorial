*Hi, this is a tutorial to show you how to edit raw videos before submitting them to WordPress Tv.

*The main goal of this tutorial is to learn how to cut unwanted part of the video, usually at the beginning or at the end of the video, or in case of unwanted interruption during the talk, how to add intro and outro slides (more info here: https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/video-editing/#3-add-intro-and-outro-panels) and, if needed, presentations slides

*In this tutorial we're going to use Shotcut, a multiplatform and open source video editor. You can download the version for your operating system from the official site shotcut.org.

*Once installed, open Shotcut and this is the default view of the application.

*The tabs we need are Properties, Playlist, Filters and Export on the left, Source and Project at the center, Jobs on the right and the Timeline at the bottom.

*If you can't see these tabs, click on "View" on the main menu and choose the tabs you want to activate.

*Now that your editor is ready, we're going to import the media we want to include in the project.

*You'll need the video of course, the intro and outro panels and, if needed, some or all of the slides of the presentation.

*To import our media click on "Open File" icon on the main bar and choose all the files you want to import, then click "Open".

*Now you can see your imported files in the Playlist tab.

*Before proceeding, we can set a useful default setting that can save some time in editing and make our process more consistent.

*Select one of the image imported and click on the "Properties" tab.

*Here we can set a default duration for image files in our video, set it to 3 seconds, or the duration you think is best for you video.

*Now we can start working on our video.

*To add a media to the project timeline drag the media from the Playlist on the Timeline at the bottom of the screen.

*Now that our video is in the Timeline, we can trim the unwanted footage at the beginning and at the end of the video.

*To do so we have to split the video and then delete the unwanted clip.

*To trim the beginning place the playhead at the end of the part you want to trim, right click on the playhead and select "Split as Playhead" on the pop-up window.

*Now that the unwanted part is separated from the main video, click on the part you want to remove and press Del/Canc key or choose "Remove" from the right click pop-up window.

*You can trim the end of the video if needed in the same way, just placing the playhead at the beginning of the clip you want to cut.

Do the same if you have to cut some of the footage in the middle of the video, cutting at the beginning and at the end of the part you want to remove, then delete the clip and reunite the main video by dragging the right part next to the left part.

When your video is ok, we can add the intro panel. Place the playhead at the very beginning of the Timeline, then drag the image from the Playlist tab to the left of the playhead and it'll be added to the Timeline at the beginning of the video.

*Then we'll add the dissolve effect to make the transition between the clips smoother.

*To do so, for example to blend the intro panel and the beginning of the video, click on the video and drag it on the left over the panel of about 1 second. Now you can see that Shotcut added a dissolve effect automatically.

*To add the same effect to the outro panel go at the end of the video (using the bottom scroll bar or the End key) and drag in the same way the outro panel onto the video track.

*Now we have a complete video with intro and outro panel and nice transitions, but in some cases we need to add some slides to the video, for example when there's important info to show to the viewer.

*To add a slide we have to create a new video track first.

*Right click on the bottom left panel and choose "Add Video Track" from the pop-up window.

If you can't see both video tracks just resize the timeline dragging the five dots in the upper part of the timeline area.

Now, choose where you want to put the slide, place the playhead where you want the slide to appear and drag the slide onto the timeline where the playhead is, you'll notice that the left side of the slide will stick to the playhead to help positioning it.

Then choose the duration of the slide, according to what is showing. If there are many lines of code that are important to the presentation you may want to keep the slide longer, if It's important but only a bit informative keep it for a short amount of time. To change the duration just drag the right side of the side.

Now we'll add a nice transition to the slide. To do so click on the slide on the timeline and activate the Filters tab on the left panel.

Click on the Plus button, choose "Fade In Video", set the duration at 1 second and tick the "Adjust opacity" box. Then click again on the Plus button and add a "Fade Out Video" filter, keeping 1 second of duration and also ticking the "Adjust opacity" box.

Check the result and repeat for any other slide you need to add to the video.

When you have add all the slide the video is now completed with an intro and outro panel, the slide and the transitions effect.

Do a quick check of the video to make sure everything is ok.

The last step is exporting the video in the right format, resolution and size.

When you're ready click on the "Export" tab on the left panel and then on the "Advanced" button at the bottom. You'll se the default settings for resolution, the size and framerate of the first video you dropped on the timeline.

You can leave this as they are, checking that the resolution is the same as the video you want to edit. Click on the "Codec" tab at the top and here you can set the quality of the video, important to reduce the size of the video under 1GB, the maximum allowed by the WordPress submit form.

The default setting is ok, but if you want you can increase or decrease the quality by clicking on the up or down arrow in the "Quality" field, that will automatically set the bitrate of your video. 

Now we'ready to export our video by clicking "Export File" at the bottom, then choosing a folder and then wait for the export to finish.

When the export is complete, check the size of the video. If it's under 1GB now you're ready to upload it, if it's more than 1GB you have to reduce the size a bit.

To do so, you can export the video reducing the quality or use a tool that can do the job for you, for example Handbrake. You can find a guide for Handbrake in the handbook at this link: https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/video-editing/compressing-video-for-upload-to-wordpress-tv.
